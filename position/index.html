                <h2>Childhood memories</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a strong memory I have from when I was 7 years old. It is so clear to me that 
                    I can picture it right now, and it makes me feel warm. It has to do with my family.
                    I had just started playing real football. Before, I was just playing in the streets of Madeira 
                    with my friends. And when I say the street, I don’t mean an empty road. I really mean a street. 
                    We didn’t have goals or anything, and we had to stop the game whenever the cars would drive by. 
                    I was completely happy doing that every day, but my father was the kitman for CF Andorinha — and 
                    he kept encouraging me to go and play for the youth team. I knew it would make him really proud, 
                    so I went.The first day, there were a lot of rules that I didn’t understand, but I loved it. I got 
                    addicted to the structure and the feeling of winning. My father was on the sidelines at every match 
                    with his big beard and his work trousers. He loved it. But my mother and my sisters had no interest 
                    in football. So every night at dinner, my father kept trying to recruit them to come see me play. 
                    It was like he was my first agent. I remember coming home from the matches with him and he’d say, 
                    “Cristiano scored a goal!”. They would say, “Oh, great.” <br/>
                    
                    One night, my father came home and said, “Cristiano scored three goals! He was unbelievable! You have 
                    to come see him play!”. But still, I would look to the sidelines before every match and see my dad 
                    standing there alone. Then one day — I will never forget this image — I was warming up and looked over 
                    and I saw my mom and sisters sitting together on the bleachers. They looked … how do I say this? 
                    They looked cozy. They were kind of huddled close together, and they were not clapping or yelling, they 
                    were just waving to me, like I was in a parade or something. They definitely looked like they had never 
                    been to a football match before. But they were there. That’s all I cared about. <br/>
                    
                    I felt so good in that moment. It meant a lot to me. It was like something switched inside of me. I was 
                    really proud. At that time, we didn’t have much money. Life was a struggle back then in Madeira. I was 
                    playing in whatever old boots my brother passed down to me or my cousins gave me. But when you’re a kid, 
                    you don’t care about money. You care about a certain feeling. And on that day, this feeling, it was very 
                    strong. I felt protected and loved. In Portuguese, we say menino querido da família.

                <h2>Glory days in Madrid</h2>
                <p>
                    I started dreaming bigger and bigger. I wanted to play for the national team, and I wanted to play 
                    for Manchester, because I watched the Premier League on TV all the time. I was mesmerized by how fast 
                    the game moved and the songs that the crowds would sing. The atmosphere was so moving to me. When I 
                    became a player for Manchester, it was a very proud moment for me, but I think it was an even prouder 
                    moment for my family. <br/>
                        
                    At first, winning trophies was very emotional for me. I remember when I won my first Champions League 
                    trophy at Manchester, it was an overwhelming feeling. Same thing with my first Ballon d’Or. But my dreams 
                    kept getting bigger. That’s the point of dreams, right? I had always admired Madrid, and I wanted a new 
                    challenge. I wanted to win trophies at Madrid, and break all the records, and become a club legend. <br/>
                        
                    Over the past eight years, I have achieved incredible things at Madrid. But to be honest, winning trophies 
                    later on in my career has become a different kind of emotion. Especially in these last two years. At Madrid, 
                    if you don’t win everything, other people consider it a failure. This is the expectation of greatness. 
                    This is my job. <br/>

                <h2>Father and son</h2>  
                <p> 
                    But when you are a father, it is a completely different feeling. A feeling that I cannot describe. 
                    This is why my time in Madrid has been special. I have been a footballer, yes, but also a father. <br/>

                    There is a moment with my son that I will always remember so clearly. When I think about it, I feel 
                    warm. It was the moment on the field after we won the last Champions League final in Cardiff. We made 
                    history that night. When I was on the pitch after the final whistle, it felt like I had sent a message 
                    to the world. But then my son came on the field to celebrate with me … and it was like the snap of a 
                    finger. Suddenly, the entire emotion changed. He was running around with Marcelo’s son. We held the 
                    trophy together. Then we walked around the field, hand in hand. It is a joy that I did not understand 
                    until I was a father. There are so many emotions happening simultaneously that you cannot describe the 
                    feeling in words. The only thing I can compare it to is how I felt when I was warming up in Madeira and 
                    I saw my mother and sister huddled together in the stands. <br/>
                    
                    When we returned to the Bernabeu to celebrate, Cristiano Jr. and Marcelito were playing around on the 
                    field in front of all the fans. It was a much different scene than when I was playing in the streets at 
                    his age, but I hope that the feeling for my son is the same as it was for me. 
                    Menino querido da família. <br/>
                    
                    After 400 matches with Madrid, winning is still my ultimate ambition. I think I was born like that. 
                    But the feeling after I win has definitely changed. This is a new chapter in my life. I had a special 
                    message engraved on my new Mercurial boots. It’s right on the heel, and the words are the last thing 
                    that I read before I lace them up and go to the tunnel. <br/>
                    
                    It is like a final reminder … a final motivation. It says, “El sueño del niño”. <br/>
                    
                    The dream of the child. <br/>
                    
                    Maybe now you understand. <br/>
                    
                    In the end, of course — my mission is the same as it has always been. I want to continue to break 
                    records at Madrid. I want to win the most titles possible. This is just my nature. <br/>
                    
                    But what means the most to me about my time in Madrid, and what I will tell my grandchildren about 
                    when I am 95 years old, is the feeling of walking around the pitch as a champion, hand in hand with 
                    my son. <br/>
                    
                    I hope we will do it again.
