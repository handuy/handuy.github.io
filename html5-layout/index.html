                <p>
                    Name: Luka Modric <br/>
                    Age: 32 <br/>
                    Team: Real Madrid <br/>
                    Nationality: Croatia <br/>
                </p>
            </aside>

            <section class="col-sm-10 col-md-9">
                <article>
                    <h2>
                        The man who made Real Madrid great again
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Upon Modric's arrival, there was confusion over what would be his role. Modric was widely described 
                        as a "mediapunta", a support striker or playmaker. Anybody who had seen him in England, though, 
                        knew that his best position was as a midfielder sitting slightly deeper, carrying the ball forward 
                        and picking out team-mates with his superb vision and range of passing. <br/>

                        There were further doubts as Mourinho left and Carlo Ancelotti came in, but the Italian had praised 
                        the midfielder on television prior to his Madrid move and decided to build his team around the 
                        Croatian. <br/>

                        It worked. With Modric pulling the strings in midfield, Madrid became a better football team. 
                        In Europe especially, he has been the catalyst for three Champions League crowns over the past four 
                        seasons: one with Ancelotti and two more with Zidane. <br/>
                        
                        In the first of those, it was a Modric corner that found Sergio Ramos for the late leveller that 
                        broke Atletico hearts in Lisbon. Ancelotti said last year: "Luka Modric is definitely one of best 
                        midfield players in the world. He has great technical abilities, reads the game and has a strong 
                        personality that he has built over the years. Besides that, he is a very pleasant person." <br/>

                        Everybody says so. And besides being thought of as a great guy, Modric is considered by most to be 
                        among the best midfielders in the world right now, perhaps even the finest of them all. Although he 
                        is not prolific in terms of goals or assists, Modric makes Madrid tick. And it is no coincidence that 
                        Real have kept winning the Champions League since he signed for what now seems a ridiculously low 
                        â‚¬35 million fee back in 2012. <br/>

                        As much and perhaps even more than anyone else, it is he who made Madrid great again.
